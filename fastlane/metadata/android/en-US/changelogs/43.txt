- Exports & backups now use a new timestamp pattern to prevent file system conflicts.
- Export & snapshot locations are now customizable; you must individually select folders for exports and backups.
- Added optional auto-deletion for old backups (disabled by default, only applies to backups made from this version onward).
- Fixed duplicate screens in the backstack when navigating via the bottom bar (by @tuuhin).
- Snapshots have been moved to a new screen: Data > Snapshots.
