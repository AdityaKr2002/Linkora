Well, primarily, Thank you for your interest in contributing to Linkora!

## How to Contribute

1. **Check the Issues**
   - Only work on issues labelled **"Open For Contribution"**.
   - If you want to contribute a new feature that doesn't exist in the issues, please create an issue first and add a comment in that issue stating that you're developing the feature and will create a PR.
   - I want to work on all other issues that are not part of this "Open For Contribution" label, so please do not submit PRs for them.
   
2. **Fork & Clone**
   - Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
   
3. **Development Guidelines**
   - Follow the project's coding style (it will just make things simpler as the project moves ahead), doesn't necessarily have to follow "best practices" and all that, but I really appreciate it if that's the case.

4. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Make sure the thing actually works as expected before making a PR, so it would be easier to test on my machine and merge it as soon as possible.
   - Reference the issue in your PR.
   - Provide a clear description of your changes; screenshots and screen recordings of your PR would help a lot, so make sure you attach them.
   - Work only one issue at a time. i.e., one PR should focus on only one issue.

## Questions or Discussions

- If you have questions, use the **Discussions** section or comment on the issue.
- Contributions that are not part of **"Open For Contribution"** labelled issues will not be accepted.
